# DASHBOARD CONFPROPRIETÀ - Quick Password Access

This is just a simple password thing to get into the Confproprietà dashboard.  It's there to keep random people out, but honestly, it's not Fort Knox.

## How to Get In

Super easy:

1.  Go to the webpage link.
2.  Type in the password when it asks.
3.  Click "Accedi."
4.  Boom, you should be in the dashboard. If it doesn't jump there automatically, there's a link on the page to click.

## Why Use This?

Basically, if you're from Confproprietà and need to see the dashboard, use this page. It's a quick way to make sure only people who should be looking at it, are looking at it.

Think of it like this:

*   Need the dashboard? Use this password page first.
*   Don't have the password?  You probably shouldn't be there anyway.

## Quick Heads-Up

*   This is **only for Confproprietà folks**.
*   **Security Stuff:**  Heads up, this is a really basic password thing.  It's not super secure, and definitely not for anything seriously important or secret.
*   Things might change here sometimes, and this little write-up might not always be updated right away. Just so you know.
